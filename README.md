# Knapsack Problem Solver 🕯️🛶🎹📭☂️
Test different search algorithms on the classic problem of knapsack.

## 🍙 Overview
Explore and evaluate three distinct search algorithms: Greedy Search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm, applied to the classic Knapsack problem. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, this empirical study aims to compare the effectiveness of these algorithms in finding optimal solutions.

## 🎆 Requirements
1. **Dataset:** Utilize the knapsack_5_items.csv" from the specified Kaggle dataset.
2. **Implementations:**
   - Generate and Test: Validate optimal solutions.
   - Greedy Search: Define and implement a greedy strategy.
   - Simulated Annealing: Implement with variations in cooling rates.
   - Genetic Algorithm: Include crossovers, mutations, and explore parameter rates.

3. **Comparative Study:** Analyze and compare the algorithms using the dataset's expected solutions, focusing on recall and the impact of parameter variations.
